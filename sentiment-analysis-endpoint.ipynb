    "#  Sentiment Analysis with TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is a very common text analytics task that involves determining whether a text sample is positive or negative about its subject.  There are several different algorithms for performing this task, including statistical algorithms and deep learning algorithms.  With respect to deep learning, a Convolutional Neural Net (CNN) is sometimes used for this purpose.  In this notebook we'll use a CNN built with TensorFlow to perform sentiment analysis in Amazon SageMaker on the IMDB dataset, which consists of movie reviews labeled as having positive or negative sentiment. Three aspects of Amazon SageMaker will be demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to use Script Mode with a prebuilt TensorFlow container, along with a training script similar to one you would use outside SageMaker. \n",
    "- Local Mode training, which allows you to test your code on your notebook instance before creating a full scale training job.\n",
    "- Batch Transform for offline, asynchronous predictions on large batches of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "#  Prepare Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by loading the reviews dataset, and padding the reviews so all reviews have the same length.  Each review is represented as an array of numbers, where each number represents an indexed word.  Training data for both Local Mode and Hosted Training must be saved as files, so we'll also save the transformed data to files."

In general, hosted training is preferred for doing actual training, especially for large-scale, distributed training.
